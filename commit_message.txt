Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-optimization-notebooks | main | feat(data): Fix data paths to use relative paths

FIXED: Changed from absolute Colab paths to relative paths.
Now uses data/X.npy and data/y.npy instead of hardcoded paths.
Created data/ directory structure and added setup instructions to README.
