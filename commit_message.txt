Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-optimization-notebooks | main | WIP(deps): Add sklearn to requirements (forgot to install)

Added scikit-learn>=1.0.0 to requirements.txt file.
BUG: Forgot to actually run pip install after updating requirements.
Still getting import error because package not installed in environment.
