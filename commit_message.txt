Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-optimization-notebooks | main | WIP(data): Try fixing MNIST import (still broken)

Attempted to fix import by adding torchvision to imports but kept old import.
Still has the bug: torch.datasets doesn't exist.
Need to actually change the import statement to use torchvision.datasets.
