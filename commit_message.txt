Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-optimization-notebooks | main | WIP(data): Add MNIST data loading (incorrect import)

Attempted to add MNIST data loading functionality.
BUG: Used incorrect import 'from torch.datasets import MNIST'.
This will cause AttributeError since torch doesn't have datasets module.
Correct import should be from torchvision.datasets.
