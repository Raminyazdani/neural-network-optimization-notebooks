Ramin Yazdani | neural-network-optimization-notebooks | main | WIP(data): Add data loading (hardcoded Colab path)

Attempted to add data loading for polynomial regression.
BUG: Used absolute Google Colab path that doesn't exist outside Colab.
Path: /content/drive/MyDrive/University of Saarland/NNTI/...
This will cause FileNotFoundError on local systems.
